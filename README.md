## Description
This project is the Part 1 & Part 2 submission for COMP 163 — **Assignment 3: Personal Data Portfolio & Git Collaboration**.

The Python program (`[username]_assignment_3.py`) demonstrates mastery of Chapter 3 data types (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) and performs the required calculations and analytics using the exact test values for Part 1. Part 2 shows how the program was customized with the student's real personal data and tracked using Git with meaningful commits.

## Files
- `[username]_assignment_3.py` — Main Python program (runs without errors; straight-line code only: no functions, loops, or conditionals).
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file).
- `git-tutorial-screenshot.png` — Screenshot showing completion of Learngitbranching Introduction sequence levels 1–4 (submit to Blackboard as required).
- (Optional) any additional personal-resource files added by the student.

## Features / Requirements Demonstrated
- Uses **all Chapter 3 data types**:
  - Strings: personal info
  - Lists: current/completed courses, credits, GPA history
  - Tuples: emergency contact, addresses, social handles (tuple indexing used)
  - Sets: skills, hobbies, backlog
  - Dictionaries: course mappings, budgets, contact directory, study hours
- Required calculations:
  - Total current credits, cumulative GPA, completed course count
  - Total weekly study hours, academic load, monthly/annual budget calculations
  - Daily food budget (rounded to 2 decimals), study cost per hour (rounded)
- Analytics: social followers total, skill counts, contact directory size, backlog count
- Output formatting: professional console output using f-strings and `round()` where needed
- Compliance: no functions, loops, or conditionals used in Part 1 solution

## How to run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed (Python 3.8+ recommended).
2. From the repository root run:
```bash
python [username]_assignment_3.py
